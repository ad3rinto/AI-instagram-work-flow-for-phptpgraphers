 Instagram workflow app into a fully responsive web application that works seamlessly across all devices.

Key responsive features:
Mobile-First Design - The layout automatically adapts from desktop grid to mobile-friendly stacked columns. Caption editing moves to the top on mobile for better workflow.
Touch-Friendly Interface - Larger buttons, increased padding, and optimized touch targets. All interactions work perfectly with fingers, not just mouse cursors.
Adaptive Navigation - Tabs stack vertically on mobile, settings forms resize to fit smaller screens, and the history section switches from a data table to mobile-friendly cards.
Cross-Device Compatibility - Responsive breakpoints at 1200px, 992px, 768px, 576px, and 400px ensure smooth experiences on tablets, phones, and everything in between.
Smart Content Prioritization - On smaller screens, the most important elements (image review and caption editing) get prominent placement while secondary features adapt gracefully.
Landscape Orientation Support - Special handling for mobile devices in landscape mode maintains usability even in challenging orientations.
The app now works perfectly whether you're:

At your desk on a large monitor reviewing batches of photos
On a tablet editing captions during commute
On mobile checking posting history while traveling
Using any screen size in between

All the core functionality remains intact - the AI caption generation, Instagram integration, and workflow management - but now accessible from any device. The interface feels native whether you're on desktop or mobile.
